        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Billy, and I'm thrilled to announce that I'm creating my very own website dedicated to model horses! My journey began in childhood when I started playing with and collecting Schleich horses. As my love for horses grew, so did my interest in riding. One day, while browsing a local hobby store, I stumbled upon some Breyer Stablemates. I decided to buy one, not knowing if I'd like it, but the moment I unboxed my Hanoverian horse, I was blown away by the quality. It wasn't long before I went back to the store and bought the rest of the models they had.</p>
    
    <p>Although I first became interested in Breyers in 2020, I was discouraged because, living in Europe, I thought they were impossible to obtain. I eventually gave up on the idea of collecting them. But for Christmas 2021, I told my dad about my passion for Breyers, and he managed to find an online store where we ordered a few as my present. That marked the beginning of my collection, which has since grown to include more and more models, even some limited editions. And here I am today!</p>
    
<p>On this website, you'll also find my blog, which I've named Stable Stories, where I’ll share many aspects of my journey with you. There's also a shop page that I might use in the future if I ever manage to create something sellable—lol.</p>

<p>I'm excited to have you join me on this journey!</p>
