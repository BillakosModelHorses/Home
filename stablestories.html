            <h3>Breyerfest Haul 2024</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on 3 September 2024</p>

            <p>Hello again! I’m a bit late to the party, but here’s my Breyerfest 2024 haul! This was my third online Breyerfest, and I purchased some of the models before the event and some a bit afterward.</p>
            <p>The first horse I got was Kirk! When I saw the promo for the 2024 Vintage Club, I knew I had to get Kirk at some point because he's a Nightlamb. As soon as Breyer released him, I quickly searched for him on eBay and managed to snag one! He became the most expensive horse in my collection, but I have zero regrets about it.</p>

            <p>Next up are the models I got straight from the Breyerfest store. In the Special Run preference form I filled out in June, I selected the Surprise Model and Fighter & Survivor. Initially, I wasn't planning on getting both because it would be quite expensive, but I figured I'd wait to see the surprise variations and mold first before deciding. I also had my eye on the Limited Edition Stablemate, Wild Things. (Last year, I missed out on Buggy, a horse I loved.) In the end, I sold my Surprise horse even though I liked every variation, and instead, I got Fighter & Survivor and Wild Things.</p>

<p>For Wild Things, I was initially hoping for the standard variation, but when I opened it and saw the green one, I instantly changed my mind and fell in love with it.</p>
<br>
<p>Of course, I also got my Athenian Lady with my online ticket! I was really nervous about the condition of the models that Breyer would send, but thankfully, mine arrived undamaged.</p>
<br>
<p>The next model I picked up was on the Monday after the Breyerfest weekend, from a seller in Europe. I found Chablis at what I thought was a great price (especially for Europe), and I couldn't let such a pretty model slip through my fingers!</p>

<p>Last but not least, while browsing eBay just for fun, I came across one of my grails: Lillian and Molly (the 2019 Vintage Club model). I couldn’t find any other listings for this set, so I decided to get it because who knows when I'd have another chance to find this pair!

<p>All in all, this was my Breyerfest 2024 haul. I really enjoyed this year's live broadcast, workshops, live auction, and more. I’m already looking forward to Breyerfest 2025 and seeing what Breyer has in store for their 75th anniversary!!</p>

<p>Please note that i got all the images from Identify your breyer website. I will update them as soon as I take mine.</p>
